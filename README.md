# CNNM
matlab code for tensor-valued time series forecasting and completion. The code includes two algorithms, DFT_L1 (Discrete Fourier Transform based L1 minimization) and CNNM (Convolution Nuclear Norm Minimization). 

Please run the following three routines to get started:

demo_1Dtimeseries.m   ---- a demo for 1D time serires forecasting

demo_imagecompletion.m  ------- a demo for image completion

demo_videoprediction.m  ------- a demo for video prediction, i.e., predicting the next q image frames of a given sequence of p frames.
